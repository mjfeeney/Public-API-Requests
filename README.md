# Public-API-Requests
For this project, I build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” will build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
